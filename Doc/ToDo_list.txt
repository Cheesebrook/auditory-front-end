This file sums up some of the content that needs to be added to the WP2 implementation.
Lines come (loosely) in priority order, feel free to rearrange them.

To do:

- Chunk-based processing of frame-based representations: First chunk always contains one fewer frame than the following chunks, dues to no-overlap in the first half-frame. Investigate if this is an issue for subsequent WPs and find a solution if it is.
- ratemapProc: Change implementation to use only a single filter object that operates on a matrix (should be faster)
- applyCenterClipping: Surprisingly long execution time, investigate if it can be optimized.
- WP2parameterHelper: Add an hyperlink also to processors that do not have extra parameters (e.g., itd_xcorr)
- WP2parameterHelper: Expand the h1 line before the hyperlinks, mention getDefaultParameters and other relevant functions for parameter handling
- Parameter handling: Use substructures in parameter structure, kind of in the way of pInfo
- Parameter handling: Make a parameter summary function to keep track of parameters (including some that are computed, e.g., cfHz) with the possibility of saving it to a log file
